# What is ARM Cortex-M3?

1. ARM:
- ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) is a company that designs low-power, high-performance processor architectures.
- STMicroelectronics licenses the Cortex-M3 design from ARM and builds it into their STM32 chips.

2. Cortex-M3:
- A specific 32-bit processor core designed for microcontrollers.
- It is part of ARM’s Cortex-M family, optimized for low-cost, real-time embedded systems.
	
STMicroelectronics (STM) is an independent semiconductor company that licenses ARM cores to use in its microcontrollers.


Relationship between STM and ARM
STM	                                                       ARM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manufactures physical microcontrollers (like STM32)	       Designs processor cores (like Cortex-M3)
Uses ARM's CPU designs under license	                   Licenses those designs to chip makers
Adds peripherals, memory, I/O, packaging, etc.	           Doesn’t make physical chips
Sells complete chips (e.g., STM32F103)	                   Sells IP (intellectual property) licenses
