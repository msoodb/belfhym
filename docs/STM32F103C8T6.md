The core ARM Cortex-M3 refers to the central processing unit (CPU) inside the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. 
Let's break it down in simple terms:
1. ARM:
  - ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) is a company that designs low-power, high-performance processor architectures.
  - STMicroelectronics licenses the Cortex-M3 design from ARM and builds it into their STM32 chips.

2. Cortex-M3:
   - A specific 32-bit processor core designed for microcontrollers.
   - It is part of ARM’s Cortex-M family, optimized for low-cost, real-time embedded systems.
