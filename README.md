# Belfhym

**Belfhym** is a palm-sized autonomous flying machine designed for precision, stealth, and control. Powered by an embedded C flight controller, this ultra-lightweight micro air vehicle (MAV) fuses real-time responsiveness with minimalist engineering.

> *"Born in silence, Belfhym slips through the air with the mind of a machine and the soul of a ghost."*
