Yes, you can create a simple "Hello World" test to verify that everything is working properly with your STM32F103 project setup using FreeRTOS and CMSIS. Since you can't print to a terminal directly, you'll typically use an interface like UART to print "Hello World" to a serial console.
Steps to Test the Setup:

1. Set Up UART for Output: Configure a UART peripheral (such as USART1) for serial communication so that you can send the "Hello World" message to your PC terminal (via a USB-to-serial converter or other similar interface).

Create FreeRTOS Task: Create a simple FreeRTOS task that sends the message via UART.
Make Sure Clock and GPIO Configuration are Correct: Ensure the STM32 clock is set up properly for UART and the GPIO pins for TX and RX are correctly initialized.
Verify the Output: Connect your STM32F103 board to a PC and open a terminal (e.g., using minicom or PuTTY) to view the output.





To simulate and test your STM32F103 firmware (belfhym.elf / .bin) on Linux (Fedora 42), your best option is to use QEMU with STM32 support.
1. Option 1: Simulate on QEMU (STM32F103)
Step 1: Install QEMU with ARM support
```sh
sudo dnf install qemu-system-arm
```

Step 2: Run your ELF in QEMU
The closest supported board is STM32VLDISCOVERY (uses STM32F100RB, very similar to F103):

```sh
qemu-system-arm \
  -M stm32vldiscovery \
  -nographic \
  -kernel belfhym.elf
```
  
Limitations
    QEMU's STM32F1 support is basic: you can test FreeRTOS boot, some memory setup, but not peripherals like timers, GPIO, UART reliably.
    If you're toggling an LED or expecting GPIO interrupts, they wonâ€™t work well in QEMU.
