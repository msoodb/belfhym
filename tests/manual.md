Yes, you can create a simple "Hello World" test to verify that everything is working properly with your STM32F103 project setup using FreeRTOS and CMSIS. Since you can't print to a terminal directly, you'll typically use an interface like UART to print "Hello World" to a serial console.
Steps to Test the Setup:

1. Set Up UART for Output: Configure a UART peripheral (such as USART1) for serial communication so that you can send the "Hello World" message to your PC terminal (via a USB-to-serial converter or other similar interface).

Create FreeRTOS Task: Create a simple FreeRTOS task that sends the message via UART.
Make Sure Clock and GPIO Configuration are Correct: Ensure the STM32 clock is set up properly for UART and the GPIO pins for TX and RX are correctly initialized.
Verify the Output: Connect your STM32F103 board to a PC and open a terminal (e.g., using minicom or PuTTY) to view the output.
